# React Multipage Website
### Built with React, Vite, and `React Router` for page navigation

The aim of this project is to gain a basic knowledge of how to use React Router.

### Basic Functionalities
- View the pages
- Navigate between pages ðŸ˜­ (The cool thing is that it's built using React Router, which I still need to learn deeply.)

### Issues with the Code
- The header might not look great on very large screens, so I'll fix that for your viewing pleasure. Aidos!
- I need to work on accessibility... I really need to ðŸ˜”
